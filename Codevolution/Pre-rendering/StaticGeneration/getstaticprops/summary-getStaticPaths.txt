Static Generation is a method of pre-rendering where the HTML pages are generated at build time.

With and without external data.

Export getStaticProps function for external data.

HTML, JavaScript and a JSON file are generated.

If you navigate directly to the page route, the HTML file is served.

If you navigate to the page route from a different route, the page is created client side using the
JavaScript and JSON prefetched from the server.
