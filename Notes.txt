why next js renders pages again after hydration?

Hi, this is the expected behavior for automatically statically optimized dynamic pages.

When a dynamic page does not leverage getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, or getInitialProps 
it is auto prerendered at build time and since the dynamic page's values can't be known during 
this stage the initial HTML doesn't isn't rendered with them so during the first render on the 
client we can't provide these values either to make sure to match the initial HTML and not break hydration.

After hydration has occurred we parse the values from the URL on the client and trigger another render 
to allow the parsed values to be used now that hydration has occurred.
